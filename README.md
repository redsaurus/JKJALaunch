#JKJALaunch#

An OS X launcher for Jedi Academy and some other Q3 engine games.

Jedi Academy Multiplayer (and a few other Q3 engine games) don’t run on Lion/Mountain Lion because of some OpenGL issues on ATI graphics cards.

JKJALaunch is a launcher for Jedi Academy Multiplayer that forces ATI FSAA off, allowing the game to run on Lion. It also allows you to specify command-line options and force 32-bit colour (as needed on certain graphics cards).

Hold Shift down at launch to bring up the options window, where you can choose the location of Jedi Academy Multiplayer and set the command-line options.

When you’re asked to find Jedi Academy MP, you can also select Jedi Academy, Jedi Knight II, Jedi Knight II MP, Wolfenstein ET and Alice.

(if Jedi Academy MP can be found in the same folder as JKJALaunch, this will be launched regardless of your preferences)

JKJALaunch uses DYLD_INTERPOSE as found in Webkit.

Currently JKJALaunch does not support the App Store version of Jedi Academy, but hopefully it will soon.
